            <p class="lead oval-bg2">"It doesn’t look all that big on most hands but it does feel bit heavy and chunky for the first few days. You’ll get used to it soon after" - Customer A</p>
            <p class="lead oval-bg2">"I got the black variant for 64K which was a crazy value for money which even I couldn’t believe so check the price for each colors and get the best one." - Customer B</p>
            <p class="lead oval-bg2">"I was a little hesitant about buying this watch because of the price...but man oh man. I LOVE THIS THING. It pairs easily with my iphone, it's a breeze to use, its super durable and it gets 2 full days of battery life for me. I run and swim with it nearly every day and it tracks both activities VERY well. " - Customer P</p>
            <p class="lead oval-bg2">"Gifted my son who enjoys and got tempted and got one for myself. It has become my daily wear against my expensive watched. It is loaded with lots of features and the watch itself is accurately design and comfortable to wear." - Customer D</p>
            <p class="lead oval-bg2">"over priced else it is good!!!" - Customer E</p>
